# Car-Rental-Management-System

This project does not reflect my current skill as a software developer.

Program developed for a fictional car rental company to efficiently manage their fleet of cars. Data is read from CSV files in the data folder. The command line interface is used to execute this program, and all changes to the company's data can be from it.
